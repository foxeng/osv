# Reference for below options (exports(5)):
# insecure: "This option requires that requests not using gss originate on an
#   Internet port less than IPPORT_RESERVED (1024). This option is on by
#   default. To turn it off, specify insecure."
# rw: Read-write. Unfortunately, we get an EPERM on open() when using the
# default (ro).
# sync: Synchronous, the default, just being explicit.
# subtree_check: Enable subtree checks, the default, just being explicit.
# fsid=0: "As not all filesystems are stored on devices, and not all filesystems
#   have UUIDs, it is sometimes necessary to explicitly tell NFS how to identify
#   a filesystem. This is done with the fsid= option.", so, may be necessary if
#   the export is e.g. ramfs.
#   "For NFSv4, there is a distinguished filesystem which is the root of all
#   exported filesystems. This is specified with fsid=root or fsid=0 both of
#   which mean exactly the same thing."
# no_root_squash: Don't map root to the nobody user (i.e. map client root to
#   server root).
